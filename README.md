VTG400 Users —
Hopefully this program makes using your VTG400 a lot easier! I’ve included just about everything I could think of, aiming to strike a good balance between functionality and simplicity.

Notes:
240p Button
This uses the first custom resolution slot on your VTG400—whatever you’ve saved there will be sent when pressed.

NTSC Settings

NTSC-J = 0 IRE (480i)

NTSC-U = 7.5 IRE (480i)

IRE Level Display
Displays the current IRE value, or “N/A” if the selected pattern (e.g. crosshatch or color bars) doesn't support variable IRE.

Color Selection
This works by disabling individual color guns (red, green, or blue) to produce the desired output.
Note: Color selection only functions properly when using RGB output.
“White” is typically the most useful mode.
Buttons will light up to show the active IRE, pattern, color, and resolution.

HCFR Integration (Optional)
When enabled, the program reads gray levels and both primary and secondary color targets from HCFR.
There’s a minor bug where the app may display “16 IRE” and light the 20 IRE button after a full sweep—don’t worry, it doesn’t affect output or change any settings.
